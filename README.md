# Sea Level Predictions Using Machine Learning
### About
This project is part of the NYU CDS Undergraduate Research Program (CURP). We attempt to provide probabilistic forecasts of sea levels using a range of machine learning models. 

This repo contains the CURP Fellows' Gaussian Process and LSTM jupyter notebooks.
